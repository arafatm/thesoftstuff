# The Soft Stuff
Openly-licensed job descriptions, interview questions, career ladders, tools and resources.

Like npm, but for technical managers and leaders.

## About this project
As technical professionals we're rarely expected to implement entire solutions completely from scratch.

Need to implement a machine learning program? Start with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

Automate your entire development, test and deployment workflow? [Sure](https://jenkins.io/).

Full-featured application framework? [Plenty](https://rubyonrails.org/) [of](https://angularjs.org/) [options](https://www.meteor.com/) [in](https://www.djangoproject.com/) [any](https://laravel.com/) [language](https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) [you](https://www.asp.net) [use](https://www.reactnative.com/).

Heck, you don't even need to write your own library to [pad a string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/left-pad).

Now that you're managing staff, why are you staring at a blank screen trying to write a job description for a Senior Software Engineer?

As technical professionals we get better at our jobs and we get better as a community by learning from each other and freely sharing the tools we use. Why should we stop doing this when we move in to management?

The Soft Stuff collects templates, tools and processes that you can implement in your organization if they don't already exist. Licenses are specified for everything linked or included so you know your rights to modify and use what you find.

## Getting involved
Do you have a resource to share? Pull Requests are very welcome. If you know of a good resource or tool for managers, you can just PR a link to it.

If you are sharing something that's not already available online, please note that content shared on this site is [openly-licensed](CONTENT-LICENSE.md). You can specify a different license or no license at all - please indicate your choice in the PR, or I'll assume you want it released under our license.

If you are not a github user and want to share or post something to The Soft Stuff, please contact me on email: jwrubel (at) gmail dot com or  [twitter](https://twitter.com/jameswrubel) and I'll be happy to help review and incorporate your change in whatever method makes the most sense, even if that's just a link to something you've already published.
