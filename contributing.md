<p>Do you have a resource to share? <a href="https://github.com/jwrubel/thesoftstuff">Pull Requests</a> are very welcome. If you know of a good resource or tool for managers, you can just PR a link to it under its category on the <a href="tools.html">Tools</a> page.</p>

<p>If you are sharing something to be included directly on The Soft Stuff and it's not already available online, please note that content stored directly on this site is <a href="CONTENT-LICENSE.md">openly-licensed</a>. You can specify a different license or no license at all - please indicate your choice in the PR, or I'll assume you want it released under our license.</p>

<p>If you are not a github user and want to share or post something to The Soft Stuff, please contact me on email: jwrubel (at) gmail dot com or <a href="https://twitter.com/jameswrubel">twitter</a> and I'll be happy to help review and incorporate your change in whatever method makes the most sense, even if that's just a link to something you've already published.</p>
