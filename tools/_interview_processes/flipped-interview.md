<p><em>Shameless plug</em> The Flipped Interview is a different way of approaching the interview portion of recruitment. It's based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom" target="_blank">Flipped Classroom</a> model that's been successfully used in education.</p>
<p>The core concept in a flipped interview is that all of the Q&A and work happens asynchronously, ahead of the interview. The interview itself, instead of being a series of questions that candidates have to answer on the spot, is used to discuss their responses.</p>
<p>This is a model that's been used with interview scenarios but to my knowledge it's not been applied to the interview itself. This model would work especially well for a remote position.</p>
<p>There's an accompanying <a href="https://www.beautiful.ai/deck/-LBBNBKF5JwsC5q8VSrv/So-what-do-you-do-in-your-spare-time" target="_blank">slide deck</a> that describes more about the process.</p>
