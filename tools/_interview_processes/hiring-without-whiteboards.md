<p>As the title implies, this is actually just the front end for an Airtable DB of companies that have pledged to interview without whiteboard coding exercises or CS trivia questions.</p>
<p>From the README:<blockquote>The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work â€“ for example pairing on a real world problem, or a paid/unpaid take home exercise.</blockquote></p>
<p>It's also worth reviewing the short list of <a href="https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/blob/master/RECOMMENDATIONS.md" target="_blank">recommendations</a> the site lists for what to do instead.</p>
