<p>This was written primarily from the candidate's point of view but many of these questions could be used as simple coding exercises. They focus on specific data structures and programming concepts so they're probably not appropriate for experienced candidates. Some examples:</p>
<div class="ui bulleted link list">
  <div class="ui item">
    Write in words for a given digit.
    E.g. 123 returns one hundred and twenty three.
  </div>
  <div class="ui item">
    Given a singly linked list (a list which can only be traversed in one direction), find the item that is located at 'k' items from the end. So if the list is a, b, c, d and k is 2 then the answer is 'c'. The solution should not search the list twice.
  </div>
  <div class="ui item">
    Given a directory of files and folders (and relevant functions), how would you parse through it to find equivalent files?
  </div>
</div>
