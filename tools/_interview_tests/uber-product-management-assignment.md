<p>A 27-slide presentation describing a hiring assignment for Uber product manager candidates. It centers around the question, data shows that there are more drop offs than pick ups at the airport. Why is this so and what would you do in the product to change that?</p><p>This is a detailed case study that's very specific to Uber but could be used for inspiration. Note that the slide deck also includes the author's submission.</p>
