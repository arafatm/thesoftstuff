<p>A few very simple interview exercises, written in java. Examples include building a <href="https://github.com/volunteermatch/interview-exercises/tree/master/java/calculator" target="_blank">basic calculator</a>, generating <a href="https://github.com/volunteermatch/interview-exercises/tree/master/java/friendlyurl" target="_blank">search-engine friendly URLs</a>, and implementing a <a href="https://github.com/volunteermatch/interview-exercises/tree/master/java/simplehashmap" target="_blank">simple hashmap</a>.</p>
<p>These would be good for using with a more junior developer or for someone you are considering whose only development experience is at a coding bootcamp.</p>
