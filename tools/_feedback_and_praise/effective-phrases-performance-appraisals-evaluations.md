<p>The U.S. military does a <em>lot</em> of written performance reviews. Since most servicemembers become eligible for formal promotion every few years, and every service award nomination comes with a several-page written justification requirement, providing unique and meaningful feedback is part of every military officer's role.</p><p>This tool has been used for decades to help officers write evaluations, nominations and reviews. It's not a book so much as a compilation of categorized short phrases. Some topics include Decision Making, Interpersonal Skills, Quality, Professionalism, and Dealing With Stress.</p><p>If you work for a larger organization this is a good book to expense and share among the management team.</p>
