<p>It's 2018, but did you know you can still learn things from reading books? If you're making the transition from individual contributor to manager or looking to improve as a leader of technical staff, you need this book. It's extremely thorough and written by someone with deep experience in this area. A kindle version is available too, if you prefer.</p>
